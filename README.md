## A File Date/Time Changer \* Major Update \*


</div>

### Description

DateChanga views and modifies the date you see when you right click a file. This can be very useful in many ways, also shows how to convert SYSTEMTIME to FILETIME etc. I have tested on vb6 in winXP and it works fine.

Please help me with some feedback regarding anything you like/dislike about this program. and please dont forget to vote.
 
### More Info
 
All you need is this and a file to be modified!

DateChanga returns the date and time when a file was created, modified and last accessed.

DateChanga can modify a programs file time entry. With some programs they check this so it can see if it has been modified which will most likely stop the program working. Be careful if modifying an exe, save as a copy first.
